\section{Introduction}
For the demo, NAO, a humanoid robot \cite{gouaillier2008} has been programmed 
to move their arms from left to right in a continues way (Fig \ref{fig:nao}).

\section{Effects of Lights with Colours}
Adquiring pictures with different light conditions
make changes of the filtered images.
It requires more investigation to tackle light 
dependencies to tackle better such problem.
It can also be raised a question regarding the consideration
of different skin colours of users when interaction with NAO.


Particularly, the reflection of light in the bricks
which make detecting less of the surface area, as well
as the use of certain colour. Green colour is hardly 
detected when using only artificial light, but 
using blue brick is a bit better, however there is 
some problems with the light reflectance that 
show a bit of white colour. Fig. \ref{fig:bbp}.
