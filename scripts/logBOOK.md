#todo

* [ ] create global variables in `detection.py` for

	```
	area_threshold=2000 # this threshold migth change according to light conditions
        tts.say("I see a LEGO piece")
	```

* [ ] Would be good to rename 
	Hand.py and hand function in `detection.py` !
	It is confusing which is the purpose of each one!
	maybe hand function as `findinghand`
